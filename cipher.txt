GENETICSLLY MODIXIED ORGAFISMS, OR GEDS, QID MLAXRZ UMA ANIMALS WHOSE GENETIC MATERIAL HAS BEEN ALTERED USING GENETIC ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES.  GENETIC ENGINEERING IS USED TO PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE OF THESE FOODS AND INCREASE THE YIELD OF CROPS BY INTRODUCING PESTICIDES IN EVERY CELL OF THE GENETICALLY ECGINEERED CROP.  IN THE UNITED STATES GMOS ARE USED IN AS MUCH AS 80% OF CONVENTIONAL PROCESSED FOODS. THE U.S. IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS AND MORE THAN A DOZEN OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE LATCHED ONTO THE TECHNOLOGY INCLUDING ARGENTINA, CANADA, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, INDIA, AND MEXICO.
	SINCE ITK INTRODUUTION, THE MSE OF GENWIISRKIY MYBPZHBD ORGANISMS (GMOS) IN FOODS HAS BEEN SURROUNDED BY CONTROVERSY.  GROUPS HAVE BROUGHT AWARENESS TO THE USE OF GMOS IN AN ATTEMPT TO SHIFT CONSUMERS TOWARDS ORGANIC AND NON-GMO FOODS.  THEIR GOAL IS TO CREATE A TIPPING POINT SO THAT THE MARKETPLACE FOR GMO FOODH COLLAPSES AND ONLY ORGANIC AND HEALTHY FOODS ARE LEFT.  IN THEORY THIS WOULD LEAD TO CHEAPER AND HEALTHIER FOODS AVAILABLE TO ALL BUT THE DEMAND FOR FOOD IS SO HIGH THAT OUR MARKET RELIES ON FOODS THAT CAN LAST LONGER AND BE PRODUCED QUICKLY AND ABUNDANTLY.
	SCIENTIXIC STUDIWS HAVE BEWN PUBLISZTD ILOMORDGUA ALTH SIDES AND THERE HAS BEEN HEAVY CRITICISM OF THE PUBLISHERS FOR BEING LINKED TO THE INDUSTRY.  IN 2011, AN ANALYSIS OF SUCH STUDIES FOUND THAT THERE WAS A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN AUTHOR AFFILIATION TO INDUSTRY AND STUDY OUTCOME.  THIS IMPLIES THE AUTHORS DF THESE STUDIES HAVE A PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT IS THE TRUTH AND WHAT ISN’T.  
	THERE ARW KNOWN RIKKS OF PROVUCING GEFTTYTZILY WMKCEFED FOODS.  THE USE OF GMOS IN FOODS RISKS INTRODUCING ALLERGENS AND TOXINS IN THOSE FOODS.  THERE IS A RISK OF ACCIDENTAL CONTAMINATION BETWEEN GENETICALLY MODIFIED AND NON-GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS.  THERE HAS BEEN EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE RISKS OF CREPTING “SUPER” WEEDS THAT HUMANS WILL BE UNABLE TO REMOVE FROM THE ENVIRONMENT.  THESE “SUPER” WEEDS COULD DISRUPT THAT ECOSYSTEM AND LEAD TO FURTHER UNFORESEEN CONSEQUENCES.  PEOPLE EATING FOODS WITH GMOS RISK DEVELOPING RESISTANCE TO ANTIBIOTICS.  THERE IS A RISK OF CHANGING THE NUTRIENT CONTENT OF THE FOODS LEADING TO LESS NUTRITIOUS FOODS.  THE USE OF GENETIC ENGINEERED ORGANISMS HAS MANY BENEFITS AS WELL.  GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS HAVE BETTER PEST AND DISEASE RESISTANCE, ARE MORE TOLERABLE TO DROUGHTS, AND HAVE A GENERAL INCREASE IN YIELD.
	THE UNITWD STATES YOVERNMEFT POSITIGC II KGXT GWMZ UQB SAFE TO EAT, RESIST DISEASE BETTER, AND PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED FOOD TO STARVING NATIONS.  THE EUROPEAN UNION ON THE OTHER HAND BELIEVES THAT THE RISK OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS OUTWEIGHS ITS BENEFITS.  THEIR OPINION IS THAT ORGANIC FOODS ARE HEALTHIER ANS THEY WANT TO KEEP GMOS OUT AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVE THE MOST STRICTEST RESTRICTIONS ON GMOS IN THE WORLD.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS ARE SAFE TO EAT UNTIL PROPER RESEARCH AND TRIALS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME CAN BE CONDUCTED.  WITHOUT ANY CLEAR SHORT-TERM NEGATIVE EFFECTS AS OF YET, GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS ARE SAFE TO EAT.
